My philosophy on iteration is to be able to write simplistic code with as few lines as possible. 
My coding style is using iteration in the most fundamental way by using loops and the each statement. I love to code to be functional yet simplistic and still have a way of unifying what I am asking the computer to do. Ilove using the each method ass well as the if, else, and elsif methods in my code. I believe by utilizing those methods my code will still be uniform and simplistic and still flow correctly with the current project.
