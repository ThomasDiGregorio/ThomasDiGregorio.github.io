I got into this field with flatiron school because since leaving college I have a bachelor's degree in Business Administration. Unfortunately, I have no experience managing people. So, I decided it was time for a career change. So, I started using Career Karma, Grasshopper to learn JavaScript and I taught myself Python 3.4 and 3.7. I also have a strong foundation in many languages including the following:  HTML5, CSS3, Git, PHP, node.JS, JSON, Ruby, Django Framework, and I just recently took on Udemy.com React.JS and Web API. Pretty soon I will be taking SQL and Angular.JS also. I have always loved video games and that's what I want to accomplish after graduation from Flatiron School. I want to learn code to make games for consoles more playable and give more of a challenge to players whether they are a seasoned vet of the title or a newbie. Coding is Fun and since starting with Flatiron Coding makes me happy.
