One thing I have found is that Flatiron School doesn't place too much emphasis on polymorphism in  Ruby.
In fact Polymorphism should be discussed since it is one of the core competencies in the language. In a nutshell the definition in laymens terms is simply this poly meaning many and morph meaning forms. Polymorphism occurs when a class that inherits from a parent class changes the behavior of a method in the parent class. I believe that the school should incorporate some aspect of this part of the language if it will be beneficial to students who want a definitive mastery of the language. This is why I feel that someday they should at least scratch the surface using this highly used competecy of the ruby language. By Thomas DiGregorio
