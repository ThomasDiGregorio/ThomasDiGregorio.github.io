My  CLI Project or what is commonly referred to as a Command Line Interface Project is basically the top 25 all time best science fiction movies of all time made into a loop in order to give the user access to the films contained therin. My experience was at the beginner level going into this project. Although, I completed it after four weeks normally two I discovered that I may have read too far into it. trying to make a simplistic kind of code initially that was easily understood and utilized but at the same time trying to make it more into an intermediate level of code. I even forgot what I have always told myself when refactoring code K.I.S..S. short for Keep It Simple Stupid. I love to write code but it has to be simplistic and understanding. I was a bit overwhelmed as this was my first project. But, seeing it completed I can safely say that I have learned a great deal utilizing the ruby language. And I forsee myself in the days ahead passing my assessment and going on to the next chapter in the course.
